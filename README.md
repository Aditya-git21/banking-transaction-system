# 🏦 High-Availability Banking Transaction System  
### Zero Data Loss • Exactly-Once Execution • Serverless AWS

---

## 🚀 Introduction
This project implements a **serverless banking transaction system** on AWS that guarantees:

✅ Exactly-once execution  
✅ Strong consistency  
✅ Automatic rollback on failure  
✅ Zero data loss  

It solves a **real-world distributed systems problem** where partial failures during money transfers can lead to inconsistencies.

The solution is built using the **Saga Pattern**, widely used in financial and payment systems.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
In distributed banking systems, a transaction may fail partially:

- 💸 Debit succeeds  
- ❌ Credit fails  
- ⚠️ System becomes inconsistent  

This project ensures that:
- ✔️ Either the transaction completes fully, or  
- 🔄 The system safely rolls back to its original state  

No partial updates. No money loss.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
The system follows a **serverless, event-driven architecture**:

- 🧠 **AWS Step Functions** – Transaction orchestrator  
- ⚙️ **AWS Lambda** – Debit, Credit, Rollback logic  
- 🗄️ **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)** – Strongly consistent data store  
- 🔐 **AWS IAM** – Secure access control  
- 📊 **CloudWatch** – Logs and observability

## 🧩 Lambda Functions

### 💳 Debit Lambda
- Checks account balance
- Performs atomic debit
- Enforces idempotency
- Records transaction state

---

### 💰 Credit Lambda
- Credits destination account
- Updates transaction status

---

### 🔄 Rollback Lambda
- Executes compensating transaction
- Restores debited amount
- Marks transaction as rolled back

Each Lambda is **stateless** and focused on a **single responsibility**.

---

## 🧠 Step Functions Orchestration
AWS Step Functions act as the **control plane** of the system:

✨ Defines execution order  
✨ Handles retries with backoff  
✨ Routes failures to rollback  
✨ Provides visual execution tracking  

Used features:
- Task states
- Retry policies
- Catch blocks
- Success & Fail states

---

## 🔑 Exactly-Once Processing
To prevent duplicate transactions:

- Each request includes an **idempotency key**
- Debit Lambda checks for existing transactions
- Duplicate requests return safely without reprocessing

This ensures **no double debit or credit**.

---

## ❌ Failure Handling
The system is designed to be **failure-resilient**:

- Any downstream failure triggers rollback
- Partial executions are automatically compensated
- Database transactions ensure consistency

💡 Result: **Zero financial data loss**

---

## 👀 Observability
- 📜 Lambda logs captured in CloudWatch
- 🧭 Step Functions show execution flow visually
- 🔍 Errors and retries are traceable end-to-end

---

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration
Each Lambda is configured using environment variables:

- DB_HOST
- DB_NAME
- DB_USER
- DB_PASSWORD
- DB_PORT

🗂️ Database Schema (Simplifie)

- 🧾 Accounts Table
- account_id
- balance

📄 Transactions Table

- txn_id
- from_account
- to_account
- amount
- status
- idempotency_key
